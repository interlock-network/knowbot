A detailed setup guide will eventually go here.

For now, these are the undetailed steps:

1. clone repo

2. change variables in `utility.py` to match org and target repo

3. create `.env` file in `src` containing `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_SERVER`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN`

4. setup discord bot and get token

5. choose a discord server

6. generate a PAT in github (necessary to avoid low API rate limit)

7. find somewhere (cloud or onprem) to host knowbot

8. run knowbot and use URL in discord dev to invite bot to server

9. use knowbot
